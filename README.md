## Todo

- [ ] Settings client-side.
- [ ] Administration using a secret on main.py.
- [ ] Try to get less detects on vt.

## How does this work?
I will be creating a tool similar to Diavlo but you will need to add your own databases (if not dumped in JSON format from phpMyAdmin contact me. My discord is on my main page.)

## When will I be able to use this?
N/A, I'm currently working hard on it. Updates will be added to the repo but I don't recommend downloading right now due to not being 100% ready.
